OpenHiven.py is an easy, fast and async API wrapper written in Python that provides extensive functionality for the Hiven Swarm and Hiven API. The OpenHiven.py module is entirely written in async and can therefore only be used in an async event loop and environment. For more info about asyncio look into the Asyncio documentation Environment \u00b6 OpenHiven.py is a Python module and can currently on be run in environments with Python >= 3.6. This is due to the used module aiohttp which requires Functionality only available in Python 3.6 or higher! Python 2 is entirely not supported, and currently, there is no plan to make OpenHiven.py available for Python 2, since many features are dependent on Python 3 and the modern async module of Python 3 as well as aiohttp! Installation \u00b6 OpenHiven.py can be easily installed using pip : PyPi Regular Installation python3 -m pip install -U openhivenpy PyPi Specific Version python3 -m pip install -U openhivenpy == version Github Build Warning Can be unstable due to development status! Only use if you need the most recent development version! python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/FrostbyteSpace/OpenHiven.py/archive/main.zip Installing OpenHiven.py will automatically also include its dependencies, which currently are: aiohttp - Asynchronous HTTP Client for OpenHiven.py asyncio - Execution of functions using asynchronous concurrent code typing - Type Hinting in Python Basic Concept \u00b6 The system of OpenHiven.py is very closely related to the discord.py (Discord Python Wrapper) module and was structured to be similar to it. Therefore, the basic concept is based on an event listener system where events are mapped to user-specified functions and methods. These will be executed when in the websocket a Hiven Swarm Event is received, enabling the user to customise the event's handling! In case of an event, Hiven will send the corresponding data over the Hiven Swarm and the websocket connection of the aiohttp HTTP-Session. That data will then be passed to the HivenClient where the Hiven Swarm message will get processed, and an event would be triggered. You can then specify in the Event Listener how the Client should react to such issues using the standard decorators . The methods will get the data passed, and you can utilise it right afterwards. This event system and handling is done over the integrated Event Handler class, which defaults to the used Client itself. Async Functions that are tagged with the @client.event() decorator will automatically be registered in the EventHandler and then called whenever an Event is triggered. Example with the event on_message_create : ... @client . event () async def on_message_create ( msg ): print ( f \" { msg . author . name } send a message: { msg . content } \" ) ... Using a UserClient \u00b6 Source Code \u00b7 openhivenpy.UserClient A UserClient object is an object that wraps the default HivenClient , which serves as a bridge between Hiven, and the Program you are using. The HivenClient contains all data and connection-vital information, but is not supposed to be used directly since some methods are not available due to the raw state. These are special methods related to the bot-type that decides based on what type you are using, resulting in various functionality. These two bot-types are here UserClient and BotClient To use the UserClient, you are also required to have a token passed, which it can use to authorise on Hiven and request data. If no token were passed, it would automatically raise an openhivenpy.exceptions.exception.InvalidToken Exception! Usage Regular Note that using a decorator will also automatically add the function as a method to the Event Handler instance itself so it can call it directly from the Event Handler and it doesn't need to reference the origin! import openhivenpy as hiven client = hiven . UserClient ( \"Insert token\" ) @client . event () async def on_ready (): print ( \"Bot is ready\" ) client . run () Inherited Decorators are useful for beginners and for a quick setup, but it is recommended to use a class which inherits the HivenClient, making the Event listener directly find the methods when needed without needing the methods to be registered. This can save time as well as remove unneeded logic import openhivenpy as hiven class Bot ( hiven . UserClient ): def __init__ ( self , token ): self . _token = token # Calling __init__ of the parent class and inheriting all methods and functionality super () . __init__ ( token ) # Not directly needed but protects the token from ever being changed! @property def token ( self ): return self . _token # Methods can be defined directly in the class async def on_ready ( self ): print ( \"Bot is ready!\" ) if __name__ == '__main__' : client = Bot ( token = \"Insert token\" ) client . run () Using a BotClient \u00b6 Source Code \u00b7 openhivenpy.BotClient A Bot Client like the UserClient is a wrapper for the main HivenClient class. It serves as a Class using bot functionality on Hiven. Therefore, it's usage is very similar to the UserClient, but it can specifically utilise Methods and functions related to text-commands and will likely receive in future versions more updates specifically adding that functionality. Warning The current release v0.1.2 the BotClient lacks major optimisation and functionality. Therefore, bugs are likely to occur! If you encounter such bugs, please report them! Hiven-Types \u00b6 Source Code \u00b7 openhivenpy.types You might have already noticed in prior examples that instead of raw data OpenHiven.py sends entire instances of Classes with the event data as parameters. This is because of the type-system OpenHiven.py uses where objects are created and initialised parallel to the corresponding Hiven ones, making it easier for usage due to the easy attribute and data access. These instances can then be used through methods to interact with the Hiven API directly, instead of you having to write your own requests for fetching the data and having to update the objects accordingly yourself. For each possible request OpenHiven.py already ships a pre-made method to the class which automatically changes data and returns configured objects if that specific methods returns data.

With logging can you can easily specify how to log errors and customize the output. Specifying the Log Level \u00b6 The module logging is based on multiple levels of importance that specified on the user input will log issues lower that level. Based on the user input it will log only these errors of its own category and higher than it. That means if WARNING was specified, ERROR and CRITICAL will also be logged. The available levels for logging are: Levels Description CRITICAL Logs only very critical errors ERROR Logs only errors WARNING Logs only warnings and errors in the program INFO Logs only vital information about the program DEBUG Logs every output related to the running program See logging levels for complete docs Simple Example of logging \u00b6 To utilise logging you are only required to import the module and specify the level. That can be done in less than two levels. Example import logging logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO ) This code snippet will activate all logging in the range of the program. That means imported modules would also log their information if they have logging used in their module. The resulting log of the prior example would then look like this: INFO:openhivenpy.gateway.http:[HTTP] Session was successfully created! INFO:openhivenpy.gateway.ws:[WEBSOCKET] >> Authorizing with token INFO:openhivenpy.gateway.ws:[WEBSOCKET] << Connection to Hiven Swarm established INFO:openhivenpy.gateway.ws:[WEBSOCKET] >> Initialization of Client was successful! INFO:openhivenpy.types.hiven_client:[CLIENT] Client loaded all data and is ready for usage! Here, the initialization was successful, and the HivenClient connected itself to Hiven and logged no errors. Info DEBUG is excellent for tracing back issues in the program and also seeing how OpenHiven.py works in the background. INFO is, on the other hand, handy for deployment and usage where the HivenClient should log only errors and vital information. We recommend sticking to one of these two, since higher levels can possibly hide very important information that you might need later if a bug occurs! Advanced Logging \u00b6 If you want to customise the entire output and also specify time and date, you can easily do that with the logging handlers. These handlers are shipped directly with logging, and you only require to create instances of them and then pass your customisations. import logging import openhivenpy logger = logging . getLogger ( \"openhivenpy\" ) logger . setLevel ( logging .

Formatter ( ' %(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s ' )) logger . addHandler ( handler ) With this snippet, time, level, and the name of the file would be logged as an addition to the message.
