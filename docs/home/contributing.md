Welcome to the Contributing page! 

If you are here to search for options to share your work and maybe
ideas for OpenHiven.py, we are delighted to hear that!

Since OpenHiven.py is a "free time" project of Developers, it is heavily dependent on user-feedback,
bug reports and also contributions of other users, so it can steadily improve and also stays up-to-date, since Hiven
can change very quickly and therefore, the library needs to also apply promptly to these new changes.

## Using Github

It is relatively easy to contribute if you do it the right way. OpenHiven.py, in this case, uses Github to host it's the
repository and manage the project. Therefore, contributions need to be made on Github since else the Developers are not 
able to correctly integrate your new changes.

If you need a guide for Github, go to the [github-guides for git and github.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### Issue-Page

The issue-page is where you can easily report issues and bugs, share your ideas, and ask questions to the developers and
other people who also use OpenHiven.py. So, if you want to contribute, that's the place to go to. Just keep in mind
trying to give as much information as possible when reporting something, so the developers who read it can understand 
the issue or contribution.

!!! Note

    For bug reporting info please go to [this page](./bug_reporting.html) 


### Contributing changes

If you found your issue, or your feature you want to work on, make a Fork of the repository and then commit changes
to that repository on your account.

Later, when you are done with the changes you wanted to make, you can make a pull-request, where we can then see
what changes you made. 

Still, for a successful and fast change, a pull-request should contain multiple things:

* A summary of changes
* Motivation and reasoning
* Possible other solutions
* Effects of the changes and issues that might be solved by them

## Summary

Committing to OpenSource-projects is essential, and that does not only count for this project but for thousands out there 
that are dependent on the users helping the project when they can! Therefore, if you already have made improvements, 
reported some bugs or will share some ideas and improvements to an open-source project, you can be sure the owners of 
the project will forever be thankful for that as long as you do it right and how they want it.
