Welcome to the Contributing page! 

If you are here to search for options to maybe share your work and
ideas for OpenHiven.py, we are very glad to hear that!

Since OpenHiven.py is a "free time" project of Developers, it is heavily dependent on user-feedback,
bug reports and also contributions of other users, so it can steadily improve and also stays up-to-date, since Hiven
can change very quickly and therefore the library needs to also apply quickly to these new changes.

## Using Github

It is relatively easy to contribute to the project if you do it the right way. 
OpenHiven.py, in this case, uses Github to host it's the repository and manage the project. Therefore, contributions
need to be made on Github since else the Developers and Repo-'Managers' cannot correctly integrate your new changes.

 If you need a guide for Github, go to the official
[github-guides for git and github.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### Issue-Page
To start, go to the [Github page](https://github.com/FrostbyteSpace/OpenHiven.py) and look into issues and see
what is happening right now. There you can see what exactly needs work, and can also discuss issues or share your ideas 
on new features and improvements. To that if you find bugs this is place where you should first look into for reporting
them and also asking for information on what to do.

!!! Note

    For bug reporting info please go to [this page](./bug_reporting.html) 


### Contributing changes

If you found your issue, or your feature you want to work on, make a Fork of the repository and then commit changes
to that repository on your account.

Later, when you are done with the changes you wanted to make, you can make a pull-request, where we can then see
what changes you made. 

Still, for a successful and fast change, a pull-request should contain multiple things:

* A summary of changes
* Motivation and reasoning
* Possible other solutions
* Effects of the changes and issues that might be solved by them

### Summary

Committing to OpenSource-projects is important and that does not only count for this project but for thousands out there that are
dependent on the user reporting bugs when they occur! Therefore, if you already have made improvements or will make some 
to an open-source project, you can be sure the owners of the project will forever be thankful for that as long as you
do it right!
